# Motif-2.0

!!For some unknown reason, the setup is not working propely, and the software loses access to the database!!
I don't feel like messing with the code since this is pretty old

This was a project made for "PAP" (Prova de Aptidão profissional -- Proof of Professional Aptitude), that is required to do in the last year of Highschool (12º). 
I decided to make an invoicing program. I didn't make it so that it's legit, because of laws, but it can be used has a guide or just for the information. 
  
You can’t really use this for anything “official” since it’s not allowed by the government. It’s only meant for personal and private use.
## Files only available in the language - Portuguese (pt-pt)

  - The file "APRESENTAÇÃO DA PAP - Motif 2.0" is a complement to the program presentation to the juris

  - The file "Relatório Final" is a final resume of the program explaining it's features and other stuff

##
```bash
The project is made on Visual Basic 2010 and the database is made on Microsoft Access 2007

It has more than 100 files, so it needs to be in a zip file (compressed).

You can just download and open it, you can then see all the files inside, plus you can also execute the program to try it out.
